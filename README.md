# Learn JavaScript Unit Testing by learning Functional Programming first!

This is code I wrote to get a better handle on unit testing with QUnit. I had an epiphany that learning unit testing required learning functional programming first.

You can read the blog post/tutorial for all this [here](http://kaidez.com/learn-javascript-unit-testing).  The [`build-complete`](https://github.com/kaidez/functional-programming-unit-testing/tree/master/build-complete) folder has the final code but you can use the code in the [`build`](https://github.com/kaidez/functional-programming-unit-testing/tree/master/build) folder to add code and follow along if you like.

To do this, make sure you have the most-recent version of [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/) globally installed on your machine. From there:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Do an `npm install`.
3. Type `npm start` in the terminal.

Then go to `http://localhost:3000`: you should a blank page with only a link to the test suite. As you update code from the tutorial in the `build` folder, you will see changes.
